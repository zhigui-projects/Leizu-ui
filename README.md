# Dashboard-UI

## Quick start
> **Before start the dashboard ui**
>
> Add an environment file called `.env` to the root folder of the project, with the required project settings and credentials. For a starter environment file, you can use this one:
> ```
> cp .env.dev .env
> ```

1. Setup the endpoint in the `.env` properly.

2. Start the nginx server to host the static files:
```
make start
```

3. Visit the [localhost](http://localhost) to explore the variety of features. :D
